# Chapter 2: Mining Bitcoin

## Background

One of the more enviable functions of a bank is the legal creation of new money. Banks do this through a process known as fractional reserve banking, where “'money' can grow to a total of 10 times the new reserves supplied to the banking system.” With a reserve requirement of ten percent of deposits, when $1.00 is deposited at the bank, $0.10 is set aside for required reserves and $0.90 can be loaned out. When the $0.90 is redeposited in the bank for safe storage, the bank then sets aside $0.09 for reserves and can loan out the remaining $0.81, and so on until required reserves equal $1.00, loans and investments equal $9.00, and total deposits equal $10.00 – all from an initial deposit of $1.00 in cash. This is the primary way that the money supply expands in legacy monetary systems based on fractional reserve banking, such as in the United States.

Like a bank, bitcoin also creates “new money,” except that this new money is not based on debt and is not yet considered legal tender by any government. Also unlike government currencies, the supply of which can expand and contract at-will due to monetary policies set by a small group of decision-makers, the maximum amount of bitcoin that will ever exist is capped by the software at 21 million BTC. A change to this cap would technically require only the agreement of the majority of the hashing power in the network, but would effectively require the agreement of the economic majority as well.

New bitcoin enters into circulation as a reward for work done by a bitcoin user's computer to secure bitcoin transactions. Transactions are secured by performing a mathematical function known as a “hash” on the transaction data until a “proof of work” is generated that matches a target set by the software. This process is referred to as “mining” and those who use their computers to do this are referred to as “miners” \(the computers themselves are also sometimes referred to as “miners”\). The more miners there are trying to generate a proof of work, the more difficult it becomes to match the target. This is to ensure that bitcoin is released at a relatively steady rate.

Bitcoin is released in limited-size “blocks,” which the network is designed to produce approximately every ten minutes. These blocks contain a block reward consisting of newly available bitcoin and transaction fees, a record of valid transactions that have happened on the network since the last accepted block, and a mathematical link to every previous block. These mathematical links form a “chain” of blocks referred to as a “block chain” - since shortened in the common vernacular to “blockchain” - which extends all the way back to the first block ever mined, known as the “genesis block.” The blockchain can be thought of as a public ledger shared by computers in the bitcoin network which keeps track of account balances and records bitcoin transfers between accounts.

Not all valid transactions are included in the next block; sometimes a transaction will take longer to be included in a block because the block is full or because there wasn't a large enough fee added to the transaction. Including a larger fee with a transaction provides an economic incentive for miners to include the transaction in the next block so that they have a chance of obtaining the fee. If a miner's block solution is accepted by a majority of the network, they will earn newly available bitcoin along with any transaction fees that have been included with transactions in the block they produced. Bitcoin is released by the system at a declining rate until none more are released. This rate started at fifty bitcoin per block and halves every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.

Since the rise in the price of bitcoin to over $1000 per BTC in November 2013, the hashrate, the measurement of computational power securing the bitcoin blockchain, has been increasing at an exponential rate. Even through the price decline of 2014, the hashrate continued rising, and continues to reach new highs as of January 2015 despite the price being as low as 20% of previous highs. This makes bitcoin mining an incredibly competitive market, highly dependent on factors such as the cost of electricity, the reliability of production and timeliness of shipments of new and improved mining hardware, and the availability of cooling technology to enable the miners to run at higher power for longer periods of time. Mining has become industrialized, with entire warehouses being filled with mining hardware to secure the blockchain and earn bitcoin. In contrast to times past when one could “solo mine” with a laptop and collect entire block rewards \(as opposed to mining with a group of miners known as a “pool” that combines computing power and splits the block rewards proportionally\), it is now uneconomical for most hobbyists to mine bitcoin.

Bitcoin miners form the backbone of the bitcoin network and are integral to both the security of the blockchain and the value of bitcoin. As the hashing power securing the bitcoin blockchain increases, so too does the amount of value which can be stored in bitcoin. The bitcoin protocol, the blockchain, and the decentralized network of bitcoin miners work together to replace the banks and other centralized “trusted third-parties” which issue currency and process and secure electronic financial transactions in the legacy financial system.
